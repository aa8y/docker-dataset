# Testing

There are two layers of tests.

**Structure tests** are static [container-structure-test][cst] configs under
`test/config/` — a shared `common.yaml` plus one file per dataset. They assert
on the image filesystem and the shipped init scripts without booting Postgres.
The configs to apply per tag are declared in `manifest.yml` under
`structureTest:` and run natively by `dave structure-test`.

**Integration (smoke) tests** actually boot each image and query the live
database. For every dataset shipped in a tag, `test/integration/run.sh`:

1. waits for Postgres to finish initializing (TCP readiness, so all init
   scripts have completed),
2. lists the base tables and asserts the set exactly matches the expected set
   (no missing tables, no unexpected extras), and
3. runs `SELECT count(*)` on every table and asserts the row counts match.

Expected tables and counts live per-dataset as JSON under `test/expected/`,
e.g. `test/expected/iso3166.json`:

```json
{
  "public.country": 242,
  "public.subcountry": 3995
}
```

keyed by schema-qualified table name, with authoritative `count(*)` values.
A value is normally an exact count. For datasets whose data is fetched from a
live upstream at build time and so drifts between builds (`omdb` from
`www.omdb.org`, `moma` from MoMA's CSV exports, and `beer` from the
Stack Exchange data dump), the value is instead a floor like
`">=59274"` and the test asserts `count(*) >=` that number. `--update` writes
floors automatically for such datasets.

These are wired into `dave test` via the `test:` template in `manifest.yml`,
which renders per tag and passes the image tag plus the one dataset baked into
it (`run.sh` still accepts a comma-separated list, so it keeps working if a
multi-dataset image is ever reintroduced). The script needs `docker` and `jq`
on the host; `psql` runs inside the container.

```sh
brew install container-structure-test jq     # one-time

dave build
dave structure-test                           # static checks
dave test                                      # live smoke tests (boots images)

# scope to specific tags locally (note: -c postgres is required with -t):
dave test -c postgres -t iso3166 -t dellstore
```

To (re)generate an expected file after an intentional dataset change, run the
script in update mode against a freshly built image:

```sh
test/integration/run.sh --update iso3166 iso3166   # <tag> <datasets-csv>
```

CI runs all three commands; see [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).
